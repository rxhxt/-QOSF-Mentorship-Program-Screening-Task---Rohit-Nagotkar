# -QOSF-Mentorship-Program-Screening-Task---Rohit-Nagotkar


Hello! my name is Rohit Nagotkar and this is my entry for the screening task of the Quantum Open Source Foundation Mentorship Program.

I chose to do TASK 1 and have successfully completed it. I chose this task because I recently started learning about Quantum Computing and Quantum circuits have alwasy peeked my curiosity. It was a very challenging task but at the same time I learnt a lot from implementing it. 

Thank you for creating this opportunity!
